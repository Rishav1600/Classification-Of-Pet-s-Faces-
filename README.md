# Classification-Of-Pet-s-Faces-
Developed a deep learning model for pet breed classification using a CNN in TensorFlow/Keras. The project involved extensive image preprocessing via NumPy and Pandas to prepare facial image datasets. The trained model successfully classifies various breeds (e.g., American Pitbull Terrier), in computer vision and machine learning model Development.
